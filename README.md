## ⚡ Who Am I?

> "I didn't just learn to build systems — I learned how to rebuild myself."

I started working in 2014 while still in high school. By 2016, I dove headfirst into the world of software development and IT infrastructure. Since then, I've built ERP systems, led remote teams, launched a tech startup, and powered through some of life’s toughest challenges.

In 2024, after launching a startup and facing major personal losses, I came back stronger — continuing my journey with Laravel, backend systems, API integrations, and cloud infrastructure. I'm not just a coder — I'm a **resilient builder** with global impact.
